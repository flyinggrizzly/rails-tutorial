# Rails directory structure

- `app/` - Core code: models, views, controllers, helpers
  - `app/assets/` - App assets (CSS, JS, images, etc)
- `bin/` - any executables exposed
- `config/` - App configuration
- `db/` - Database files
- `doc/` - Application docs
- `lib/` Library modules @todo('what is the diff between `lib` files and core code?')
  - `lib/assets/` - As `app/assets/`, but library files
- `log/` - Application logs
- `public/` - Externally accessible files, like error pages or other static files
- `bin/rails` - Rails executable for generating code, starting console sessions, or starting a local server
- `test/` - All your tests. Maybe most important directory?
- `tmp/` - Temporary files go here
- `vendor/` - As `app/` and `lib/`, but for 3rd party stuff
  - `vendor/assets/` - ibid
- `README.md` - it's in the name
- `Rakefile` - Utility tasks exposed by the `rake` command
- `Gemfile` - Gems required for the app
- `Gemfile.lock` - A list of gems used to ensure that all copies of the app use the same versions (if the `Gemfile` is the shopping list, this is your receipt)
- `config.ru` - Config file for [Rack middleware](http://rack.github.io/) @todo('look up and research Rack')
- `.gitignore` - files to ignore with git
