# Rails

## Running locally

`[bundle exec] rails [server | s] [-b <IP>] [-p <PORT>] `

- `server` and `s` are interchangeable
- you can specify IP and port for running

## Interacting on the CLI

`[bundle exec] rails console` gives you an IRB session with your application loaded into the environment.
